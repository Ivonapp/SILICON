Project name: Silicon.

Silicon is a responsive website built with a mobile-first approach,
with the main goal of creating a clean, modern and user-friendly website.

The design offers dark mode for a comfortable viewing experience, and adapts to any screen size — whether you’re browsing on a phone, tablet or desktop.

By blending Grid and Flexbox, Silicon is also flexible and easy to update as the project grows
and/or allowing future updates and design changes to be implemented smoothly.
